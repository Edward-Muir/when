## Era Reference

Events are automatically assigned to eras based on `year`:

| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Prehistory  | -4,500,000,000 to -3,001 |

| World Wars  | 1,914 to 1,945           |

| Modern      | 1,992 to 2,100           |

## Workflow for Adding Events

### 1. Check for Duplicates First

Before adding, search existing events:

```bash
# Search by name pattern
grep -r "battle-of" public/events/

# Search by year
grep -r '"year": -490' public/events/

# Run duplicate checker
npm run find-duplicates
```

### 2. Determine Category

Choose the **primary** nature of the event:

- Military action → `conflict`
- Political/legal → `diplomatic`
- Religious/artistic/philosophical → `cultural`
- Scientific/technological → `exploration`
- Building/monument → `infrastructure`
- Natural disaster/plague → `disasters`

### 3. Add Event to Correct File

Append to the appropriate `public/events/*.json` file. Maintain valid JSON array format.

### 4. Verify After Adding

```bash
npm run find-duplicates  # Check for duplicate names
npm run build            # Verify JSON is valid
```

## Naming Conventions

### `name` field (kebab-case ID)

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `battle-of-thermopylae`
- Be descriptive and unique: `death-alexander-great` not just `alexander`
- Common prefixes: `battle-`, `treaty-of-`, `invention-of-`, `birth-`, `death-`

### `friendly_name` (display name)

- Title Case: "Battle of Thermopylae"
- Can include verbs: "Completed", "Begins", "Founded", "Signed"
- Keep concise: 2-6 words typical

### `description` conventions

- Factual, objective tone
- 1-2 sentences
- Include key figures, locations, or significance
- No speculation or editorializing

## Examples by Category

### Conflict

```json
{
  "name": "battle-of-marathon",

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Duplicate names** - Always search before adding
2. **Wrong year sign** - BCE years must be negative
3. **Category mismatch** - A battle goes in `conflict`, not `diplomatic`
4. **Too long descriptions** - Keep under 150 characters
5. **Invalid JSON** - Missing commas, unclosed brackets
6. **Non-unique names** - `name` field must be globally unique
